# Linear-Regression-Project
This project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of building and evaluating a Simple Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn. The goal is to explore the relationship between Horsepower and Fuel Economy (MPG) in cars, while practicing key steps in the data science pipeline.

Objectives
• Understand the theory and intuition behind simple linear regression models.
• Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset.
• Apply feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
• Visualize the relationship between horsepower and fuel efficiency using Seaborn/Matplotlib.
• Build, train, and test a Simple Linear Regression model in Sklearn.
• Evaluate model performance with error metrics and visualize the regression line.
Project Workflow
• Data Cleaning – handle missing values, rename columns, filter outliers.
• Feature Engineering – select relevant predictors (Horsepower) and target (Fuel Economy).
• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – histograms, scatterplots, pairplots, regression line fitting.
• Model Training – fit a LinearRegression model in Scikit-learn.
• Model Testing – predict on test data, calculate error metrics (MAE, MSE, R²).
• Visualization – plot predicted vs. actual values, regression line overlay.
Tech Stack
• Python
• Pandas & NumPy – data handling
• Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization
• Scikit-learn – regression modeling
